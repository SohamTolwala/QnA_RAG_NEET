        "generated_answer": "(2) National Parks\n\nReason: National Parks are a method of in-situ conservation, not ex-situ conservation. In-situ conservation involves the conservation of genetic resources within natural or human-made ecosystems where they occur, such as protected areas like National Parks. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves conservation measures taken outside of the natural habitat.",
